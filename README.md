**Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning**
This repository contains code for time series forecasting using various machine learning models. The aim of this project is to compare the performance of different algorithms in forecasting time series data.

**Getting Started**
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository to your local machine:**
      **git clone https://github.com/code-boss-code/stockpriceforcasting.git**
**Install the required dependencies:**

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is a time series dataset containing historical data of a particular phenomenon. It includes features such as timestamp and value of the phenomenon at each timestamp.

**Models**
The following machine learning models are implemented and evaluated in this project:

  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
  - ETS (Exponential Smoothing State Space Model)
  - SVR (Support Vector Regression)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
  - Prophet
  - ARIMA and ANN (Hybrid)
  - SARIMA
**Evaluation Metrics**
The performance of each model is evaluated using the following metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Contributing**
Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request with any improvements or suggestions.
